Problem: Search a 2D Matrix II
------------------------------
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a target value in an m x n matrix.
Each row is sorted in ascending order from left to right, and each column is sorted
in ascending order from top to bottom.

Approach (One-liner):
Start from the top-right corner and eliminate one row or one column in each step.

Time Complexity: O(m + n)
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” constant extra space
